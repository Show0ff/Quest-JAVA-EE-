# SocialWebSite
A social network that is being developed by me.
Initially, the site was conceived as a quest with the possibility of "yes" /"no" answers,
but I decided to expand the functionality to the "social network" format, the quest still remained, but now it is in the "Games" section.

Implemented functionality: registration, authorization, roles (administrator, user, guest), the administrator can edit other users, a personal "wall" with each user's profile, the ability to leave messages on the wall and play a quest game with statistics.


This is an http site using Java servlets and jsp technologies, the application is implemented on the basis of MVC
I use Java core and Java EE (Jakarta), TomCat, Maven, Junit 5, log4j.
