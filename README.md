# SocialWebSite
You got to the site with my social network. Initially, 
the site was developed as a quest with the possibility of yes / no answers, 
but I decided to expand the functionality to the "social network" format, 
the quest still remained, but now it is in the "Games" section.


This is http site using Java Servlets and jsp technologies, the application is implemented based on MVC
I use Java core and Java EE (Jakarta), TomCat, Maven, Junit5, log4j.
